A relatively simple simulator using MatLab plots to show the evoloution of the (inner) solar system planets around the sun. Has the option to lineraly accelerate the sun with a particular vector to see how the planets behave.

All of the inputs have default values to show the normal solar system behavior, so the input phase can be quickly skipped through by pressing enter a few times.

The percision at which the calculations are done can be changed, although it can take a relatively long time above a value of 90.

When the sun has a high acceleration and the planet's orbits become onbounded (will no longer return to the star), the physics aren't perfect. However, up to that point they seem to behave properly. I could fix this, and add a number of other realistic features (i.e. elliptical orbits), but I would prefer to find a nicer way to display it all first.
